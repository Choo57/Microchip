<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
A friend asked if we can build a mockup circuit they can use in their paintball "Stop the bomb" game. The circuit has a main key switch, so it can only be turned on/off by the key holder (game host). Team A, whose task would be to "detonate the target", would enter a "deactivation code" using the keypad on the circuit and hide the key to a location where Team B wouldn't know. Team B's goal would be to find the deactivation key, since the "bomb", a.k.a the circuit, can only be stopped if the correct deactivcation code was entered, with a maximum of three attempts, before the configured time on the bomb runs out. LED's and a 9V buzzer was used as visual & audible indicators on the device.
